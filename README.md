# Python | Introduction to Python

## Background
These 2 scripts are to show the implementation of concepts learned from the Fintech Bootcamp Python Introduction modules. 

## PyBank
The purpose of this module is to analyse the financial records of a financial dataset provided in csv format. The dataset contains 2 columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The script calculates the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyRamen
The purpose of this script is to create a tool that analyses data per product based on 2 datasets in csv file format (menu data and sales data). The script reads in the data and performs data manipulation to calcualate the following metrics per menu item sold:
* count
* revenue
* cost of goods sold 
* profit  

The output of this script is written to a report dictionary and to a text file.
